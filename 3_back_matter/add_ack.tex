Concerning the haemoglobin spectrophotometry study presented in Section~\ref{sect:co2hb:pulse_carbametry}, I would like to express my special thanks to Karine Pichavant for her technical and scientific support during the measurements, Céline Théron for her technical help, and Sylvain Gioux for his redacting advices.

Concerning the clinical study on transcutaneous \gls{co2} diffusion reported in Section~\ref{sect:tcco2:frontiers_article}, I wish to warmly thank Hervé Abitbol and the Tecmatel Engineering team for their design of the adhesive mounting jig, Julien Dolou for his help in the administrative formalities involved in conducting the clinical study, and Alexandre Desvaux, Mikaël Jamet (Cimtech) and Lucien Lecurieux Lafayette (Troisel) for their help in the design and manufacturing of the aluminium sensor body.

Concerning the theoretical developments on the accuracy of phase estimation developed in Section~\ref{sect:choos:phase_mes}, I am particularly grateful to Yoshitate Takakura for his valuable insights in spectral estimation, and to Morgan Madec for his meticulous early review of this work.

Concerning the experimentations linked to the \gls{co2}-sensing thin film's design presented in Section~\ref{sect:thin_film:results}, I would like to thank Jeanne Beyrle, who did great during her six months internship, de-risking several avenues. I would also like to thank Stéphane Roques, Nicolas Zimmerman, and Damien Favier for their technical support.
