# On the Presented Haemoglobin Spectra

As stated in Dervieux et al. (2020) "Measuring Haemoglobin Spectra: Searching for Carbamino-Haemoglobin", the given spectra are provided "as is" and **measurement artifacts are still present** at 590nm for O2Hb and 600nm for HHb and CO2Hb.

The absorbance unit is ```(cm-1).(mol-1).L```, the same as [Scott Prahl's spectra](https://omlc.org/spectra/hemoglobin/).
